# Auth0 + AngularJS + API Seed

This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create an AngularJS app that will use Auth0 and an API that we're going to be developing. The API can be in any language.
If you want to connect to a third party API like Firebase or Amazon, please check this other seed.
