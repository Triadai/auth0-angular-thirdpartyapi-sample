# Auth0 + AngularJS + Third Party API Seed

This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create an AngularJS app that will use Auth0 and a Third party API like Firebase or Amazon.

To see the example working, just go to http://auth0.github.io/auth0-angular-thirdpartyapi-sample/compile/

If you want to connect to an API that you're going to develop in any language, please [this other seed](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular-api-sample).

## Running the example

In order to run the example you need to have `npm`, `bower` and `grunt` installed.

If you don't have `bower` or `grunt` installed please run:

````js
npm install -g bower
npm install -g grunt-cli
````

Then, in the project main folder run the following commands:

````js
npm install
bower install
grunt watch
````

Go to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see the app running :).
