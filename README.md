# Auth0 + AngularJS + Third Party API Seed

This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create an AngularJS app that will use Auth0 and a Third party API like Firebase or Amazon.

To see the example working, just go to http://auth0.github.io/auth0-angular-thirdparty-sample/compile/

If you want to connect to an API that you're going to develop in any language, please [this other seed](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular-api-sample).
